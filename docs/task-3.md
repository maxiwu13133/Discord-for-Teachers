## Discord Server

Servers in Discord are like a large group chat in which individuals can join and interact with others that share the same interests as them. For example, a server for 
poeple who want to learn a programming language, or a server for people who go to the same school. In this section, we show you how you can create own server which can
be used a classroom.

## Roles in Discord

One of the amazing features of Discord is that it allows you to assign roles to members of the server in order to manage the server easier. For a classroom, you can use this 
feature to divide your students into different groups for pojects, or you can simply divide them if there are more than one set or one grade students in your server.
